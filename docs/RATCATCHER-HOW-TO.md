# RatCatcher — Ops & Recovery How-To

**Last updated:** April 2026  
**Author:** Mark Berry  
**Purpose:** Everything you (or Claude Code) need to understand, maintain, and restore RatCatcher from scratch.

---

## What Is RatCatcher?

RatCatcher is a **PowerShell forensic scanner** built to detect evidence of the March 31, 2026 Axios NPM supply chain attack. It consists of two main parts:

1. **The Scanner** — a PowerShell script (`Invoke-RatCatcher.ps1`) that employees run on their machines. It runs 10 checks, generates HTML reports, and submits results to the dashboard.
2. **The Dashboard** — a Cloudflare Worker that receives scan submissions, stores them, runs AI verdict analysis, and provides a web UI for the security team to review results.

The live dashboard is at: **https://mbfromit.com/ratcatcher/dashboard**

### Cloudflare (Production Infrastructure)
| Resource | Type | Name / ID |
|---|---|---|
| Worker | Cloudflare Worker | `ratcatcher` |
| Database | D1 (SQLite) | `ratcatcher` — ID: `b535d898-8007-4fc8-8f41-63da8dd1f1a3` |
| Reports storage | R2 bucket | `ratcatcher-reports` |
| Route | DNS | `mbfromit.com/ratcatcher/*` |
| Cron | Worker trigger | `*/5 * * * *` (auto-evaluates new COMPROMISED submissions) |
| Cloudflare Account | Login | `mbfromit@gmail.com` |

### Dev Environment (Cloudflare)
| Resource | Type | Name / ID |
|---|---|---|
| Worker | Cloudflare Worker | `ratcatcher-dev` |
| Database | D1 (SQLite) | `ratcatcher-dev` — ID: `90e9640b-afe2-4e81-9734-b1a0731b5e91` |
| Reports storage | R2 bucket | `ratcatcher-dev-reports` |
| Route | DNS | `mbfromit.com/ratcatcher-dev/*` |

### Credentials
All secrets are stored in **`/Users/mberry/.claude/.env`**.

Key variables:
- `RATCATCHER_ADMIN_PASSWORD` — the admin password for the dashboard web UI **and** the submission password employees enter when running the scanner. Same value for both.
- `CLOUDFLARE_KEY` — Cloudflare API key (used by wrangler for deployments).

The Worker also has two **Cloudflare-side secrets** (set via `wrangler secret`):
- `ADMIN_PASSWORD` — must match `RATCATCHER_ADMIN_PASSWORD` above.
- `AI_TUNNEL_URL` — URL of the Cloudflare Tunnel to the Ollama/Gemma AI instance (see AI section below).
- `AI_API_KEY` — API key for the AI tunnel.

> **Note:** The Worker secrets are stored in Cloudflare, not locally. To view or update them: Cloudflare Dashboard → Workers → ratcatcher → Settings → Variables & Secrets.

## How the Dashboard Works

The dashboard is a **single Cloudflare Worker** (`src/index.js`) that handles everything:

- `GET /ratcatcher/dashboard` → serves the dashboard HTML (requires X-Admin-Password header or prompt)
- `POST /ratcatcher/submit` → receives scan submissions from the PowerShell scanner
- `GET /api/stats` → JSON stats for the dashboard filter cards
- `GET /api/submissions` → paginated submission list with filtering
- `GET /api/report/:id` → serves stored HTML report from R2
- `POST /api/submissions/:id/ai-verify` → triggers AI verdict for one submission
- `POST /api/ai-verify-all` → bulk AI evaluation (also triggered by the `*/5 * * * *` cron)
- `GET /api/ai-status` → checks if Gemma model is loaded
- Various `/api/submissions/:id/ack` routes for finding acknowledgements

### Dashboard Filter Cards (what each one counts)
All cards reflect the **most recent scan per hostname** (fleet state), not historical totals.

| Card | What it shows |
|---|---|
| **Total Scans** | All rows ever submitted |
| **Unique Scans** | COUNT DISTINCT hostnames (one per machine, latest scan) |
| **Clean** | Latest scan per host = CLEAN |
| **Positive Findings** | Latest scan = COMPROMISED + not reviewed/false-positived |
| **Unreviewed** | Latest scan = COMPROMISED + not reviewed (matches Positive Findings) |
| **Remediated** | Machines that were previously COMPROMISED but latest scan = CLEAN, OR were reviewed/certified after compromise |
| **Reviewed** | Submissions that have been manually certified or false-positived |

## How to Deploy (after code changes)

All deployments go through **wrangler** from the `cloudflare/` directory.

```bash
cd /Users/mberry/Documents/ClaudeProjects/RatCatcher/cloudflare

# Deploy to production
npx wrangler deploy

# Deploy to dev environment
npx wrangler deploy --env dev
```

That's it. No pipeline — just push via wrangler directly. The Worker is live within seconds.

**Before deploying**, run tests:
```bash
cd /Users/mberry/Documents/ClaudeProjects/RatCatcher/cloudflare
npm test
```

---

## How to Restore from Backup

### Scenario: Worker code is broken or accidentally deleted

```bash
cd /Users/mberry/Documents/ClaudeProjects/RatCatcher/cloudflare
npx wrangler deploy
```

That re-deploys everything from the source code in this repo.

### Scenario: D1 database is lost or corrupted

A SQL backup is kept at:
```
/Users/mberry/Documents/ClaudeProjects/RatCatcher/ratcatcher-db-backup-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.sql
```

To restore:
```bash
cd /Users/mberry/Documents/ClaudeProjects/RatCatcher/cloudflare

# Restore to production DB
npx wrangler d1 execute ratcatcher --file=../ratcatcher-db-backup-20260413-113526.sql --remote

# If you need to recreate the DB schema first (empty DB):
npx wrangler d1 execute ratcatcher --file=schema.sql --remote
```

### Scenario: Worker secrets are gone (e.g. account reset)

Re-set them via wrangler:
```bash
# You'll be prompted to enter the value
npx wrangler secret put ADMIN_PASSWORD
npx wrangler secret put AI_TUNNEL_URL
npx wrangler secret put AI_API_KEY
```

Values are in `/Users/mberry/.claude/.env`.

### Scenario: Full DR — starting from zero on a fresh Cloudflare account

1. Create D1 databases: `npx wrangler d1 create ratcatcher` and `npx wrangler d1 create ratcatcher-dev`
2. Update the database IDs in `wrangler.toml` with the new IDs from step 1
3. Apply schema: `npx wrangler d1 execute ratcatcher --file=schema.sql --remote`
4. Restore data from backup SQL file (see above)
5. Create R2 buckets: `npx wrangler r2 bucket create ratcatcher-reports` and `ratcatcher-dev-reports`
6. Set secrets: `ADMIN_PASSWORD`, `AI_TUNNEL_URL`, `AI_API_KEY`
7. Deploy: `npx wrangler deploy`

## AI Verification (Gemma) — Current Status: OFFLINE

RatCatcher uses **Gemma 4 (31B)** running via **Ollama** to automatically evaluate each finding and return a verdict (Confirmed / Likely / Unlikely / FalsePositive).

### Architecture
```
Cloudflare Worker  →  Cloudflare Tunnel  →  AWS instance running Ollama + Gemma 4 31B
```

The Worker calls `env.AI_TUNNEL_URL` (the tunnel URL) with an API key (`env.AI_API_KEY`).

### Current State
The AWS Gemma instance was **intentionally shut down in April 2026** — the incident response is complete. The Worker handles this gracefully: if `AI_TUNNEL_URL` is not set or the model is unreachable, all AI features return a 503 and the dashboard's AI buttons are non-functional. Everything else (dashboard, submissions, manual review) works normally.

**Existing AI verdicts in the database are preserved** — they don't disappear when the model goes offline.

### To Re-enable AI (if needed for a future incident)

1. Spin up an AWS instance with enough VRAM for Gemma 4 31B (~24GB minimum)
2. Install Ollama: https://ollama.com — then `ollama pull gemma4:31b`
3. Create a Cloudflare Tunnel to the instance exposing port 11434 (Ollama's default)
4. Set up an API key on the tunnel for authentication
5. Update Cloudflare Worker secrets:
   ```bash
   npx wrangler secret put AI_TUNNEL_URL   # e.g. https://your-tunnel.cfargotunnel.com
   npx wrangler secret put AI_API_KEY      # your tunnel API key
   ```
6. Test via the dashboard → any COMPROMISED submission → click "Re-Evaluate"

## Database Schema (Quick Reference)

Key tables in D1:

| Table | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `submissions` | One row per scan. Columns: `id`, `hostname`, `username`, `submitted_at`, `verdict` (CLEAN/COMPROMISED), `ai_verdict`, `findings_count`, `report_key` (R2 key), `reviewed` |
| `finding_acknowledgements` | Manager certifications and false-positive overrides per finding |
| `finding_ai_verdicts` | Per-finding AI verdict detail (verdict, reason, category) |

To export the live database at any time:
```bash
cd /Users/mberry/Documents/ClaudeProjects/RatCatcher/cloudflare
npx wrangler d1 export ratcatcher --remote --output=../ratcatcher-db-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S).sql
```

## What to Tell Claude Code

If starting a fresh session, give Claude Code this prompt to get it up to speed instantly:

---

> **Context for Claude Code:**
>
> I need help with **RatCatcher**, a PowerShell security scanner with a Cloudflare Worker dashboard.
>
> **Source code:** `/Users/mberry/Documents/ClaudeProjects/RatCatcher/`

> **Key files:**
> - `Invoke-RatCatcher.ps1` — PowerShell scanner (runs on employee machines)
> - `cloudflare/src/handlers/api.js` — dashboard API (stats, submissions, report serving)
> - `cloudflare/src/handlers/dashboard.js` — dashboard HTML/JS frontend
> - `cloudflare/src/handlers/ai-verify.js` — Gemma AI verdict logic
> - `cloudflare/wrangler.toml` — deployment config (D1 + R2 bindings, routes, cron)
> - `cloudflare/schema.sql` — D1 database schema
> - `docs/RATCATCHER-HOW-TO.md` — full architecture reference
>
> **Credentials:** `/Users/mberry/.claude/.env` contains `RATCATCHER_ADMIN_PASSWORD` and `CLOUDFLARE_KEY`.
>
> **Deploy:** `cd cloudflare && npx wrangler deploy` (no pipeline — direct wrangler push).
>
> **Live URL:** https://mbfromit.com/ratcatcher/dashboard
>
> The AI (Gemma) is currently **offline** — the AWS instance was shut down after the incident response was complete. The Worker handles this gracefully.
